                <p>Let me start like this, I'm just an ordinary guy who has some dreams and I'd like to go and achieve them, one of those dreams has always been to be an artist in some direction, these days there are a lot of those directions and I've tried a <b>MANY</b> of them, but when I saw the website <a href="https://lepshee.com/cs/">LEPSHEE</a> while working as a programmer, I found what I can excel at</p>
            
                <p>When I was choosing my secondary school, I had no idea what I could go to, but I ended up following my best friend to a secondary technical school specialized in computer science, we can safely say that it was the right decision because I loved computers itself.</p>

                <p>The way they taught programming at my secondary school is laughable to me, the teacher opens wikipedia and reads line by line and with any question they are more confused than the student who asked. Then I tried college with a personal interest in programming only, but college teaches you one way out of a million and any other way is non-existent to them.</p>

                <p>And so here we are, a young boy who refuses to learn with the help of school and so I spend hours every day learning the things I need to achieve my dreams.</p>
